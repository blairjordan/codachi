## Features

- Gain XP by writing more code.
- When enough XP is gained, your monster will level up!

## Getting Started

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`), paste the following command, and press Enter.

```
Codachi: Show Panel
```

This will show the Codachi panel. Your pet will wander around here.

To spawn a new pet, hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` again, paste the following command, and press Enter:

```
Codachi: New Pet
```

Your pet will appear (inside an egg). Start typing to hatch your pet.

Your pet will gain XP as you code.

<i>The Codachi panel must remain open for your pet to gain XP.</i>
