## Features

- Hatch random pets with original designs and animations.
- Gain XP by writing more code.
- When enough XP is gained, your monster will level up!
- Choose between Panel mode or Explorer mode to display your pet.

## Getting Started

### Panel Mode (Default)

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`), paste the following command, and press Enter.

```
Codachi: Show Panel
```

This will show the Codachi panel. Your pet will wander around here.

### Explorer Mode

To use Explorer mode instead, run:

```
Codachi: Open Explorer View
```

Your pet will now appear in the Explorer panel. This keeps your pet visible while you work.

### Spawning a New Pet

To spawn a new pet, hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`, paste the following command, and press Enter:

```
Codachi: New Pet
```

Your pet will appear (inside an egg). Start typing to hatch your pet.

Your pet will gain XP as you code in either mode.

### Switching Between Modes

You can switch between Panel and Explorer modes in two ways:

1. **Via Settings**:

   - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl` + `,`)
   - Search for "codachi.position"
   - Select either "panel" or "explorer"

2. **Via Commands**:
   - Use `Codachi: Show Panel` to switch to Panel mode
   - Use `Codachi: Open Explorer View` to switch to Explorer mode

### Enabling the XP Counter

By default, the XP counter is hidden. To enable it:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl` + `,`)
2. Search for "codachi.showXP"
3. Check the box to enable the XP bar

The XP counter will appear in the top left corner of your Codachi view, showing your current XP and the total XP needed to reach the next level.
